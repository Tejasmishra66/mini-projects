### üìå **Project Title**
**Spam Detector using Pretrained ML Model & TF-IDF Vectorizer**

### üìù **Project Description**
This Spam Detector is a lightweight Python tool that classifies messages as spam or not using a pretrained machine learning model and a TF-IDF vectorizer. Designed for fast, offline predictions, it‚Äôs ideal for integrating into messaging platforms, email clients, or chatbot pipelines. The model and vectorizer are serialized using `joblib` for quick loading and deployment.


### ‚öôÔ∏è **Features**
- Pretrained spam classification model
- TF-IDF-based text vectorization
- Simple Python script for prediction
- Fast, offline message classification
- Easily integrable into larger systems

### üß∞ **Tech Stack**
- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, joblib, pandas (optional for input handling)  
- **Model:** Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes (based on training)  
- **Vectorizer:** TF-IDF  

 **Use Cases**
- Email and SMS spam filtering  
- Chatbot message hygiene  
- Preprocessing for NLP pipelines
